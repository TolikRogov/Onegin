		My uncle was an honest man,
When he got sick in a funny way,
He made himself respected
He could do no better.
His example is a lesson to others;
But, my God, what a bore
To sit with a sick man day and night,
without taking a step away!
What low treachery
To amuse a half-dead man,
To adjust his pillows,
To bring him his medicine sadly,
Sighing and thinking to yourself:
“When will the devil take you?”
That's what the young hustler thought,
“Flying in the dust on the mail,
By the will of Zeus.
Heir to all his family.
Friends of Ludmila and Ruslan!
To the hero of my novel
Without preface, this very hour
Let me introduce you:
Onegin, my good friend,
Was born on the banks of the Neva,
Where perhaps you were born
Or shone, my reader;
I once walked there too:
But the north is bad for me.
And he hurries to live and feels in a hurry.
Prince Vyazemsky.
Having served honorably and nobly,
His father lived by debts,
He gave three balls every year
And wasted away at last.
Fate kept Eugene safe:
First Madame followed him,
Then Monsieur took her place.
The child was sharp but sweet.
Monsieur l'Abbé, a poor Frenchman,
So that the child should not be tormented,
He taught him everything in jest,
He did not bore him with strict morals,
He scolded him a little for mischief
And took him for walks in the Summer Garden.
When the rebellious youth
Eugene's time came,
A time of hope and tender sadness,
Monsieur was banished from the court.
Here's my Onegin at liberty;
Cut in the latest fashion;
Dressed like a London dandy.
And at last he sees the light.
He could speak French perfectly
He could speak and write;
He danced the mazurka with ease
And bowed with ease;
What more do you want? The world has decided
That he was clever and very sweet.
We all learned a little
We've all learned a little something and a little something,
And so, thank God,
It's not hard for us to shine.
Onegin was, in the opinion of many.
(Judges, resolute and strict)
A scholarly little fellow, but a pedant:
He had a happy talent
Without compulsion in conversation
To touch everything lightly,
With a scholarly air of a connoisseur
To keep silence in an important dispute.
And excite the smiles of the ladies
with the fire of unexpected epigrams.
Latin is out of fashion now:
So, to tell you the truth,
He knew Latin enough,
to parse the epigraphs,
To talk of Juvenal,
and put a vale at the end of the letter,
He remembered, though not without sin,
two verses from the Aeneid.
He had no desire to dig through the chronological dust
in the chronological dust
in the chronological dust of the earth's history;
But the anecdotes of bygone days
From Romulus to the present day
He kept them in his memory.
He had no higher passion
For the sounds of life he could not spare,
He could not distinguish iambic from choric,
No matter how hard we tried, he could not tell the difference.
He scorned Homer, Theocritus;
But read Adam Smith,
He was a profound economist,
That is, he could judge how a state
How the state grows rich,
And what it lives on, and why
It doesn't need gold
When it has a simple product.
His father could not understand him
And he pledged his lands.
All that Eugene yet knew,
I can't tell you;
But in what he was a true genius,
What he knew better than all the sciences,
What was for him of all his days
and labor and agony and joy,
What occupied all the day long
His lazy laziness and his longing laziness
was the science of tender passion,
which Nazon had sung,
For which he ended his brilliant and rebellious age
His brilliant and rebellious age
In Moldavia, in the wilderness of the steppes,
Far from his Italy.
How early he was able to hypocritize,
To conceal hope, to be jealous,
“To disbelieve, to make you believe,
To seem gloomy, to seem despondent,
To be proud and obedient,
Attentive or indifferent!
How languidly silent he was,
How fervently eloquent,
How careless in his letters of the heart!
Breathing one thing, loving one thing,
How he could forget himself!
How quick and tender was his eye,
He was shy and bold, and at other times
How his eyes shone with obedient tears!
How he knew how to seem new,
How he could amaze innocence with jest,
To frighten with despair,
To amuse with pleasant flattery,
To catch a moment's delight,
Of innocent years of prejudice
To conquer with wit and passion,
To expect involuntary caresses,
To plead and demand confession,
To hear the first sound of the heart,
Pursue love, and then suddenly
To get a secret rendezvous.
And afterward, in private
To give her lessons in silence!
How early could he disturb
The hearts of the ladies of record!
When he wanted to destroy
When he wanted to destroy his rivals,
How he sarcastically maligned them!
What nets he prepared for them!
But ye blessed husbands,
You were his friends:
He was caressed by his wicked spouse,
who was a disciple of Phoblos,
and the distrustful old man,
And the cuckold's majestic cuckold,
Always satisfied with himself,
with his dinner and his wife.
He'd be still in bed:
And notes are brought to him.
What? Invitations? Indeed,
Three houses are calling for a party:
There'll be a ball, there'll be a children's party.
Where will my mischief-maker go?
Who will he start with? I don't care:
It's not hard to keep up.
For now in his morning dress,
Wearing a broad bolivar,
Onegin goes to the boulevard
And there he walks in the open air,
Till a watchful burgher
rings his dinner bell.
It's dark: he sits down in his sledge.
“Fall down, fall down!” - he shouts;
The frosty dust is silvery
His beaver collar.
He rushes to Talon: he's sure,
He was sure that Kaverin was waiting for him there.
He went in, and the cork hit the ceiling,
A comet's current of wine spurted out,
The roast-beef was bloody before him,
And truffles, the luxury of his youth,
French cuisine's finest color,
And Strasbourg's imperishable pie
Between the cheese of Limburg
And a golden pineapple.
More glasses, thirsty begging
To douse the hot fat of the cutlets,
But the clang of the breguet tells them
That a new ballet has begun.
The theater's evil legislator,
A fickle admirer
Of charming actresses,
An honorable citizen of the backstage,
Onegin flew to the theater,
Where everyone, breathing freely,
Ready to clap the entrechat,
To smear Phaedra, Cleopatra,
To summon Moina,
To be heard.
A magical land! There in the old days,
Satire's bold lord,
Fonvizin, the friend of liberty,
And Knyazhnin, the friend of liberty;
There Ozerov's tribute was unwillingly paid
of people's tears and applause
He shared with the young Semyonova;
There our Katenin resurrected
Corneille's majestic genius;
There the prickly Shakhovskoy brought out
his comedies a noisy swarm,
There Diderot was crowned with glory,
There, there, under the shadow of the backstage
My youthful days were spent there.
My goddesses! What are you? Where are you?
Hear my sorrowful voice:
Are you still the same maidens? Are you not the same maidens?
have not replaced you?
Will I hear your choruses again?
Will I see the Russian Terpsichore
With soul-filled flight?
Or shall my gloomy eye find no familiar faces
familiar faces on the dull stage,
And, looking at the alien light.
And the disappointed lorgnette,
The spectator of mirth is indifferent,
I'll yawn silently
And reminisce of the past?
The theater is full; the boxes are shining;
The parterre and the seats are all abuzz;
And the rak'ryck is splashing impatiently,
And the curtain rises, and makes a noise.
Glittering, half-air,
and the magic bow is obedient,
surrounded by a crowd of nymphs,
Standing there is Istomina,
With one foot touching the floor,
With the other she slowly circles,
And suddenly she leaps, and suddenly she flies,
She flies like fluff from the lips of Aeolus;
And then she'll take her stance, and then she'll take her stride, and then she'll take her stride,
And with a quick foot she beats her foot.
All clapping. Onegin enters,
He walks between the chairs on his feet,
He points his double lorgnette obliquely.
On the boxes of the ladies he doesn't know;
He looked over all the tiers,
He saw everything: faces, attire
He's terribly displeased;
He bowed to the men on every side
He bowed, and then to the stage.
He looked at the stage in great distraction
He turned away and yawned,
And said: “It's time for a change;
“I have long endured ballets,
“But I've had enough of Didlo.
“There are still cupids, devils, snakes.
On the stage, they gallop and clamor;
“Tired footmen
Sleep on their coats at the door;
They're still stomping
Blowing their noses, coughing, coughing, shushing, clapping;
Outside and inside
The lanterns are shining everywhere;
The horses are still chillin' and beating,
and their harnesses bore them,
And the coachmen, around the lights,
They scold their masters and beat their hands:
And Onegin went out;
He's going home to dress.
Shall I depict in a faithful picture
A secluded study,
where the fashionable pupil
Dressed, undressed, and dressed again?
All the things that for whimsy's abundance
that London trades in the lavish trade.
And on the Baltic waves
For lumber and lard to us,
All that Paris tastes hungry for,
A useful trade in the world,
invented for amusement,
For luxury, for luxury, for fashionable relaxation.
All adorned the office
The philosopher's office at eighteen.
Amber on the pipes of Tzaregrad,
Porcelain and bronze on the table,
And the pampering of the senses,
Perfume in cut crystal;
Combs, files of steel,
Straight scissors, crooked scissors,
And brushes of thirty kinds
For nails and teeth.
Rousseau (in passing)
Couldn't understand how the important Grim
Dared to brush his nails before him,
The eloquent madman.
The defender of liberty and right
In this case is not right at all.
It's possible to be a man of sense
and think of the beauty of your nails:
Why argue fruitlessly with the age?
Custom is a despot among men.
The second Chadaev, my Eugene,
Afraid of jealous judgment,
He was a pedant in his clothes
And what we called a dandy.
He spent three hours at least
in front of the mirrors
And came out of the restroom
Like a breezy Venus,
When, wearing a man's attire,
The goddess goes to the masquerade.
In the last taste of toilette
To occupy your curious gaze,
I could before the learned light
Here to describe his attire;
It would be brave, indeed,
To describe my own business:
But pantaloons, tailcoat, vest,
All these words are not in Russian;
And I see I blame myself before you,
That my poor syllable, as it is.
could be much less crowded
with foreign words,
though I had looked in the old days
in the Academic Dictionary.
It's not the same with us now:
We'd better hurry to the ball,
Where my Onegin has gone in a coach.
Where my Onegin has already ridden.
In front of the faded houses
Along the sleepy street in rows
The double lanterns of the carriage
Pour out a cheerful light
And rainbows on the snow:
Dotted with carrots all round,
The splendid house gleams;
Shadows walk through the solid windows,
The profiles of heads glimmering
Of ladies and fashionable geezers.
Here comes our hero to the hall;
He passed the doorman with an arrow
He flew up the marble steps,
And spread his hair with his hand,
He entered. The hall is full of people;
The music was tired;
The crowd is busy with the mazurka;
There's noise and crowding all around;
The cavalier's spurs are clattering;
The feet of the ladies are flying;
In their captivating footsteps
The fiery gazes of the ladies are flying,
And the roar of the horns is drowned out
The jealous whispers of fashionable wives.
In the days of mirth and desire
I was crazy about balls:
There's no better place for confessions
Or to give a letter.
O ye honorable spouses!
I offer you my services;
I ask you to notice my speech:
I have a word of warning for you.
You also, mothers, be strict
Follow your daughters:
Keep your lorgnette straight!
Or else. or else, God forbid!
That's why I'm writing this,
Because I have not sinned for a long time.
Alas, I've wasted a lot of my life
I've wasted many a life!
But if my morals had not suffered,
I'd still love a ball.
I love the frenzy of youth,
I love the crowdedness, the splendor, and the joy,
And the ladies' thoughtful attire;
I love their feet, but I don't think
You'll not find in Russia
Three pairs of slender women's legs.
Ah! For a long time I couldn't forget
Two legs... Sad, chilled,
I remember them all, and in my dreams
They stir my heart.
When, and where, in what desert,
madman, will you forget them?
Ah, feet, feet! Where are you now?
Where are the flowers of spring?
Cultivated in the eastern gentleness,
On the snow of the north
You left no footprints:
You loved the soft carpets
The luxurious touch of the soft carpets.
How long have I forgotten for you
And longed for glory and praise,
and the land of my fathers and my imprisonment?
The happiness of my youth is gone.
Like your light footprints in the meadows.
Diana's bosom, Flora's laniths.
Lovely, sweet friends!
But Terpsichore's foot
is more lovely to me.
She, prophesying to my eye
A reward inestimable,
It attracts by its conventional beauty
The desires of the willful swarm.
I love her, my friend Elvina,
Beneath the long tablecloth,
In spring on the grass of the meadows,
In winter on the cast iron of the fireplace,
On the mirrored parquet of the hall,
By the sea on the granite of the cliffs.
I remember the sea before the storm:
How I envied the waves
“of the stormy waves
To lie lovingly at her feet!
How I longed with the waves
To touch her feet with my lips!
No, never in the fervent days
Of my boiling youth
have I ever wished with such anguish
to lick the lips of young Armida,
or the roses of flaming palms,
or the peaches full of languor;
No, never did a passion of passion
has ever so tormented my soul!
I remember another time!
In dreams sometimes cherished
I hold a happy footstep.
And feel the foot in my hand;
And my imagination is again aflame,
Her touch again
and her touch makes my faded heart blaze,
I long again, I love again.
But let us glorify the haughty
with their talkative lyre;
They are not worthy of passion,
nor the songs they inspire:
The words and eyes of these enchantresses
are as deceitful as their feet.
What of my Onegin? Half asleep
He's on his way to bed from the ball:
And St. Petersburg is restless
is awakened by the drum.
The merchant rises, the peddler comes,
The cabman goes to the stock exchange,
A woman with a jug of water is hurrying along,
The morning snow is crunching beneath her.
The noise of the morning is pleasant.
The shutters are open; the trumpet smoke
Rises in a column of blue smoke,
And the bread-maker, a neat German,
in his paper hat, has more than once
has already opened his vasisdas.
But, weary with the noise of the ball,
and the morning turns to midnight,
Sleeps peacefully in the shade of the blissful.
A child of amusement and luxury.
Wakes at noon, and again.
His life is ready for the morning,
and his life is monotonous and variegated.
And tomorrow is the same as yesterday.
But was my Eugene happy,
Free, in the bloom of his best years,
In the midst of glorious triumphs,
In the midst of daily pleasures?
Was he ever so happy in the midst of feasts
Careless and healthy?
No: his senses were soon cold in him;
He was bored with the noise of the world;
The beauties were not long
The subject of his habitual thoughts;
Treason had tired him out;
Friends and friendship bore him,
'Cause he couldn't always
Beef-steaks and Strasburger pie.
To pour champagne on a bottle
And sprinkle a sharp word
When he had a headache
And though he was an ardent lover
But at last he fell out of love
the sword and the sword and the lead.
An affliction, the cause of which
that should have been found long ago,
Like the English splendor,
In short, Russian moping
has taken possession of him;
He shot himself, thank God,
He didn't want to try it,
But he had grown cold to life.
Like Child-Harold, sullen and languid.
He appeared in the drawing-rooms;
No gossip of light, no boston,
nor a sweet look, nor an immodest sigh,
Nothing touched him,
He noticed nothing.
Fanciers of the great world!
He left you all before him;
And it is true that in our summer
The highest tone is rather dull;
Though it may be that some lady
may talk of Seay and Bentham,
But their conversation in general
But their talk is unbearable, though it be innocent nonsense;
And yet they are so pure,
So stately, so clever,
So full of piety,
So discreet, so precise,
So unapproachable to men,
So unapproachable to men.
And you young beauties
who, in the late hours of the day.
Who are carried away by the carriages of good fortune
On St. Petersburg's sidewalk,
And my Eugene has left you.
A renegade of stormy pleasures,
Onegin locked himself up at home,
and, yawning, took up his pen,
He wanted to write, but his hard work
But he could not bear it; nothing
Nothing came out of his pen,
And he didn't get into the cheerful workshop.
Of men I don't judge,
because I belong to them.
And again, devoted to idleness,
and languishing in his soul's emptiness,
He sits down with the laudable purpose
To appropriate to himself the mind of others;
And with a troop of books he filled his shelf,
He read, he read, he read, but to no avail:
There's boredom, there's deceit, there's nonsense;
There's conscience, there's no sense;
There's a different kind of burden on everyone;
And the old is out of date,
And the old is delirious with newness.
Like women, he left the books,
And the shelf with their dusty family,
and the shelf with their dusty family.
The conditions of light, and the burden of light,
Like him, retired from the world,
I befriended him at that time.
I liked his features,
His involuntary devotion to his dreams,
His inimitable strangeness
And a sharp, chilled mind.
I was angry, he was sullen;
We both knew the game of passion:
The life of both of us was a torment;
The heat of the heart was gone in both of us;
Both of us awaited the malice
Of blind Fortune and men
On the very morning of our days.
He who has lived and thought cannot
In his soul not despise men;
He who has felt is troubled
The ghost of days gone by
There's no more charms for him.
The serpent of remembrance,
That remorse gnaws at him.
All this often gives
A great charm to the conversation.
At first Onegin's tongue
confounded me; but I was accustomed
to his sarcastic argument,
and his jesting with bile and bile,
and the malice of his gloomy epigrams.
How often in the summertime
When the night sky above Nevoya
The night sky above the Neva,
And the water's cheerful glass
does not reflect the face of Diana,
Remembering the romances of former years,
Remembering old loves,
Sensitive, carefree again,
With the benevolent breath of the night.
We silently reveled in it!
As in the green forest from prison
The well-dweller is carried from his sleep,
So we were carried away by a dream
To the beginning of a young life.
With a soul full of regrets,
And leaning on the granite,
Eugene stood pensive,
as the Piet described himself.
All was silent; only the watchmen of the night
The sentries of the night;
and the distant clatter of the droves
From Millionnya suddenly sounded;
Only a boat, waving its oars,
And the boat waved its oars and sailed down the slumbering river:
And we were captivated in the distance
The horn and the song
But sweeter, in the midst of the night's amusement,
The tune of Torquat's octaves!
The Adriatic waves,
O Brenta! No, I'll see you,
I'll be inspired again,
I'll hear your magic voice!
It is holy to the grandsons of Apollo;
By the proud lyre of Albion
It is familiar to me, it is dear to me.
In the golden nights of Italy
I'll enjoy it in the wild,
with a young Venetian woman,
who speaks and speaks and speaks not,
Sailing in a mysterious gondola;
With her my lips shall find
The language of Petrarch and love.
Will the hour of my freedom come?
It's time, it's time! - I call out to her;
I wander over the sea, waiting for the weather,
The winds of the ship's breeze.
Beneath the tempest's veil and the waves,
On the free crossroads of the sea
When will I start my free run?
It's time to leave the dull shore
of the unpleasant elements,
And in the midday swells,
under the sky of Africa,
To sigh for gloomy Russia,
Where I have suffered, where I have loved,
Where I buried my heart.
Onegin was ready with me
To see foreign lands;
But we were soon divorced
We were divorced for a long time.
His father was dead then.
In front of Onegin was gathered
A greedy regiment of moneylenders.
Each had his own wit and reason:
Eugene, hating litigation,
content with his lot,
He gave them his inheritance,
and seeing no great loss in it.
Or foreseeing from afar
of his old uncle's death.
Suddenly he received a report
A report from the steward
that his uncle was dead in his bed
and would be glad to bid him farewell.
When he read the sad message,
Eugene immediately went to see him.
He rushed at once to the post-office.
And was yawning beforehand,
Preparing himself for the sake of money,
for sighs, boredom, and deceit.
(And thus began my romance);
But when I flew to my uncle's village,
I found it on the table,
As a tribute to the land.
He found the court full of favors;
The dead man's friends and foes
and foes and friends came to see the dead man,
The hunters of the funeral.
The dead man was buried.
The priests and guests ate and drank,
And afterward they went away,
As if they were doing business.
Here's our Onegin, a villager,
Plants, waters, forests, lands
A complete master, but until now
An enemy of order and a waster,
And he's very glad that he's changed his old ways
He's glad he's changed to something new.
For two days it seemed new to him
The lonely fields,
The coolness of the dusky oak-tree,
The sound of a quiet brook;
The third day the grove, the hill, and the field
The grove, the hill, and the field did not occupy him;
And then they made him sleep;
Then he saw clearly
That the same boredom was in the village,
Though there be no streets, no palaces,
no cards, no balls, no poems.
Chandra was waiting for him on his watch,
And she ran after him,
Like a shadow or a faithful wife.
I was born to a life of peace,
For the quiet of the countryside:
In the wilderness, the lyrical voice is more resounding,
The more lively the creative dreams.
I devote myself to innocent leisure,
I wander over a deserted lake,
And far niente is my law.
I am awakened every morning
To sweet comfort and freedom:
I read little, sleep long,
I don't catch any flying glory.
Was it not so in my former years
Spent my happiest days in idleness, in the shadows.
My happiest days?
Flowers, love, country, idleness,
Fields! I am devoted to you with my soul.
I'm always glad to notice the difference
between Onegin and myself,
That a mocking reader
Or any publisher
of intricate calumny,
When I here compare my features,
and then ungodly repeat it,
That I have painted my portrait,
Like Byron, the proud poet,
As if it were impossible for us
To write poems about another,
but of ourselves.
Let me say, by the way, that all poets.
Love's dreamy friend.
I've dreamt of lovely objects
I've dreamed, and my soul
I have kept their secret image;
and the Muse brought them to life:
And so I, careless, have sung.
The maiden of the mountains, my ideal,
and the captive women of the Salgir's shores.
Now from you, my friends,
I often hear the question:
“Who does your lyre sigh for?
To whom, in the crowd of jealous maidens,
“To whom, in a crowd of jealous maidens?
Whose glance, stirring inspiration,
Whose eye, with sweet caresses.
To whom did thy thoughtful singing?
Whom did thy verse worship?”
And, my friends, no one, by God!
Love's maddening anxiety
I have been sadly troubled.
Blessed is he that hath combined with it.
The hotness of rhyme: he hath doubled the sacred delirium
The sacred delirium of poetry,
and Petrarch in his footsteps,
and soothed the anguish of his heart,
He caught fame in the meantime;
But I was foolish and foolish in love.
Love passed, the Muse appeared,
And the dark mind is clear
Free, I seek again the union
of magic sounds, feelings and thoughts;
I write, and my heart does not yearn,
The pen, forgetting itself, does not draw,
Near the unfinished verses,
No woman's feet, no woman's head;
The ashes that are burnt out will not flare up,
I'm still sad, but there are no tears,
And soon, soon the trace of the storm
I'll soon, I'll soon, I'll soon, I'll soon, I'll soon, I'll soon, I'll soon:
Then I'll begin to write
A poem of twenty-five songs.
I have thought of the form of the plan,
And what I'll name the hero;
For now of my novel
I have finished the first chapter;
I've reviewed the whole thing rigorously:
There are many contradictions,
But I don't want to correct them.
I'll pay my debt to the censors,
I'll give the fruits of my labors
I'll give them the fruits of my labors:
Come to the shores of the Neva,
Newborn creation,
And earn my glory:
and the crooked talk, the clamor, and the swearing!
