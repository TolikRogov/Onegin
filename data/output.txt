A child of amusement and luxury.
A comet's current of wine spurted out,
A complete master, but until now
A fickle admirer
Afraid of jealous judgment,
A great charm to the conversation.
A greedy regiment of moneylenders.
Ah, feet, feet! Where are you now?
Ah! For a long time I couldn't forget
Alas, I've wasted a lot of my life
All adorned the office
All clapping. Onegin enters,
All that Eugene yet knew,
All that Paris tastes hungry for,
All these words are not in Russian;
All the things that for whimsy's abundance
All this often gives
All was silent; only the watchmen of the night
Along the sleepy street in rows
Always satisfied with himself,
A magical land! There in the old days,
Amber on the pipes of Tzaregrad,
An affliction, the cause of which
And afterward, in private
And afterward they went away,
And again, devoted to idleness,
And a golden pineapple.
And a sharp, chilled mind.
And at last he sees the light.
And bowed with ease;
And brushes of thirty kinds
And came out of the restroom
And earn my glory:
And excite the smiles of the ladies
And far niente is my law.
And feel the foot in my hand;
and foes and friends came to see the dead man,
And he didn't get into the cheerful workshop.
And he hurries to live and feels in a hurry.
And he pledged his lands.
and her touch makes my faded heart blaze,
And he's very glad that he's changed his old ways
and his jesting with bile and bile,
and his life is monotonous and variegated.
And in the midday swells,
And I see I blame myself before you,
And it is true that in our summer
And Knyazhnin, the friend of liberty;
and labor and agony and joy,
and languishing in his soul's emptiness,
And leaning on the granite,
And longed for glory and praise,
And, looking at the alien light.
And my Eugene has left you.
And, my friends, no one, by God!
And my imagination is again aflame,
And notes are brought to him.
And Onegin went out;
And on the Baltic waves
and Petrarch in his footsteps,
and put a vale at the end of the letter,
And rainbows on the snow:
And reminisce of the past?
And said: “It's time for a change;
and seeing no great loss in it.
And she ran after him,
And so I, careless, have sung.
And soon, soon the trace of the storm
and soothed the anguish of his heart,
And so, thank God,
And spread his hair with his hand,
And sprinkle a sharp word
And St. Petersburg is restless
And Strasbourg's imperishable pie
And suddenly she leaps, and suddenly she flies,
And the boat waved its oars and sailed down the slumbering river:
And the bread-maker, a neat German,
and the captive women of the Salgir's shores.
And the coachmen, around the lights,
and the crooked talk, the clamor, and the swearing!
And the cuckold's majestic cuckold,
And the curtain rises, and makes a noise.
And the dark mind is clear
And the disappointed lorgnette,
and the distant clatter of the droves
and the distrustful old man,
and their harnesses bore them,
And the ladies' thoughtful attire;
and the land of my fathers and my imprisonment?
and the magic bow is obedient,
and the malice of his gloomy epigrams.
and the morning turns to midnight,
and the Muse brought them to life:
And then she'll take her stance, and then she'll take her stride, and then she'll take her stride,
And then they made him sleep;
and then ungodly repeat it,
And the old is delirious with newness.
And the old is out of date,
And the pampering of the senses,
And the rak'ryck is splashing impatiently,
And there he walks in the open air,
And the roar of the horns is drowned out
And the shelf with their dusty family,
and the shelf with their dusty family.
And the water's cheerful glass
and think of the beauty of your nails:
And though he was an ardent lover
(And thus began my romance);
And tomorrow is the same as yesterday.
And took him for walks in the Summer Garden.
And truffles, the luxury of his youth,
And wasted away at last.
And was yawning beforehand,
And we were captivated in the distance
And what I'll name the hero;
And what it lives on, and why
And what we called a dandy.
And with a quick foot she beats her foot.
And with a troop of books he filled his shelf,
and would be glad to bid him farewell.
and, yawning, took up his pen,
And yet they are so pure,
And you young beauties
An enemy of order and a waster,
An honorable citizen of the backstage,
A poem of twenty-five songs.
are as deceitful as their feet.
A renegade of stormy pleasures,
A report from the steward
A reward inestimable,
Are you still the same maidens? Are you not the same maidens?
As a tribute to the land.
A scholarly little fellow, but a pedant:
A secluded study,
As if it were impossible for us
As if they were doing business.
As in the green forest from prison
as the Piet described himself.
At first Onegin's tongue
A time of hope and tender sadness,
Attentive or indifferent!
A useful trade in the world,
A woman with a jug of water is hurrying along,
because I belong to them.
Because I have not sinned for a long time.
Beef-steaks and Strasburger pie.
Beneath the long tablecloth,
Beneath the tempest's veil and the waves,
between Onegin and myself,
Between the cheese of Limburg
Blessed is he that hath combined with it.
Blowing their noses, coughing, coughing, shushing, clapping;
Both of us awaited the malice
Breathing one thing, loving one thing,
But at last he fell out of love
But he could not bear it; nothing
But he had grown cold to life.
But I don't want to correct them.
But if my morals had not suffered,
But in what he was a true genius,
“But I've had enough of Didlo.
But I was foolish and foolish in love.
But let us glorify the haughty
But, my God, what a bore
but of ourselves.
But pantaloons, tailcoat, vest,
But read Adam Smith,
But sweeter, in the midst of the night's amusement,
But Terpsichore's foot
But the anecdotes of bygone days
But the clang of the breguet tells them
But their conversation in general
But their talk is unbearable, though it be innocent nonsense;
But the north is bad for me.
But was my Eugene happy,
But, weary with the noise of the ball,
But we were soon divorced
But when I flew to my uncle's village,
But ye blessed husbands,
By the proud lyre of Albion
By the sea on the granite of the cliffs.
By the will of Zeus.
Careless and healthy?
'Cause he couldn't always
Chandra was waiting for him on his watch,
Combs, files of steel,
Come to the shores of the Neva,
confounded me; but I was accustomed
content with his lot,
Corneille's majestic genius;
could be much less crowded
Couldn't understand how the important Grim
Cultivated in the eastern gentleness,
Custom is a despot among men.
Cut in the latest fashion;
Dared to brush his nails before him,
Diana's bosom, Flora's laniths.
does not reflect the face of Diana,
Dotted with carrots all round,
Dressed like a London dandy.
Dressed, undressed, and dressed again?
Each had his own wit and reason:
Eugene, hating litigation,
Eugene immediately went to see him.
Eugene's time came,
Eugene stood pensive,
“Fall down, fall down!” - he shouts;
familiar faces on the dull stage,
Fanciers of the great world!
Far from his Italy.
Fate kept Eugene safe:
Fields! I am devoted to you with my soul.
First Madame followed him,
Flowers, love, country, idleness,
“Flying in the dust on the mail,
Follow your daughters:
Fonvizin, the friend of liberty,
For lumber and lard to us,
For luxury, for luxury, for fashionable relaxation.
For nails and teeth.
For now in his morning dress,
For now of my novel
for sighs, boredom, and deceit.
For the quiet of the countryside:
For the sounds of life he could not spare,
For two days it seemed new to him
For which he ended his brilliant and rebellious age
Free, in the bloom of his best years,
Free, I seek again the union
French cuisine's finest color,
Friends and friendship bore him,
Friends of Ludmila and Ruslan!
From Millionnya suddenly sounded;
From Romulus to the present day
Glittering, half-air,
has already opened his vasisdas.
has ever so tormented my soul!
has taken possession of him;
have I ever wished with such anguish
have not replaced you?
Having served honorably and nobly,
He appeared in the drawing-rooms;
Hear my sorrowful voice:
He bowed, and then to the stage.
He bowed to the men on every side
He caught fame in the meantime;
He could do no better.
He could not distinguish iambic from choric,
He could speak and write;
He could speak French perfectly
He danced the mazurka with ease
He'd be still in bed:
He did not bore him with strict morals,
He didn't want to try it,
He entered. The hall is full of people;
He flew up the marble steps,
He found the court full of favors;
He gave them his inheritance,
He gave three balls every year
He had a happy talent
He had no desire to dig through the chronological dust
He had no higher passion
Heir to all his family.
He kept them in his memory.
He knew Latin enough,
He left you all before him;
He looked at the stage in great distraction
He looked over all the tiers,
He made himself respected
He noticed nothing.
He passed the doorman with an arrow
He points his double lorgnette obliquely.
He read, he read, he read, but to no avail:
Here comes our hero to the hall;
He remembered, though not without sin,
Here's my Onegin at liberty;
Here's our Onegin, a villager,
Here to describe his attire;
Her touch again
He rushed at once to the post-office.
He rushes to Talon: he's sure,
He saw everything: faces, attire
He scolded him a little for mischief
He scorned Homer, Theocritus;
He's glad he's changed to something new.
He's going home to dress.
He shared with the young Semyonova;
He shot himself, thank God,
He sits down with the laudable purpose
He's on his way to bed from the ball:
He spent three hours at least
He's terribly displeased;
He taught him everything in jest,
He turned away and yawned,
He walks between the chairs on his feet,
He wanted to write, but his hard work
He was a pedant in his clothes
He was a profound economist,
He was bored with the noise of the world;
He was caressed by his wicked spouse,
He was shy and bold, and at other times
He was sure that Kaverin was waiting for him there.
He went in, and the cork hit the ceiling,
He who has felt is troubled
He who has lived and thought cannot
His beaver collar.
His brilliant and rebellious age
his comedies a noisy swarm,
His example is a lesson to others;
His father could not understand him
His father lived by debts,
His father was dead then.
His inimitable strangeness
His involuntary devotion to his dreams,
His lazy laziness and his longing laziness
His life is ready for the morning,
How careless in his letters of the heart!
How early could he disturb
How early he was able to hypocritize,
How fervently eloquent,
How he could amaze innocence with jest,
How he could forget himself!
How he knew how to seem new,
How he sarcastically maligned them!
How his eyes shone with obedient tears!
How I envied the waves
How I longed with the waves
How languidly silent he was,
How long have I forgotten for you
How often in the summertime
How quick and tender was his eye,
How the state grows rich,
I am awakened every morning
I ask you to notice my speech:
I befriended him at that time.
I can't tell you;
I could before the learned light
I devote myself to innocent leisure,
I don't catch any flying glory.
I'd still love a ball.
I found it on the table,
I have a word of warning for you.
I have been sadly troubled.
I have finished the first chapter;
I have kept their secret image;
“I have long endured ballets,
I have thought of the form of the plan,
I hold a happy footstep.
I liked his features,
I'll be inspired again,
I'll enjoy it in the wild,
I'll give the fruits of my labors
I'll give them the fruits of my labors:
I'll hear your magic voice!
I'll pay my debt to the censors,
I'll soon, I'll soon, I'll soon, I'll soon, I'll soon, I'll soon, I'll soon:
I'll yawn silently
I long again, I love again.
I love her, my friend Elvina,
I love the crowdedness, the splendor, and the joy,
I love the frenzy of youth,
I love their feet, but I don't think
I'm always glad to notice the difference
I'm still sad, but there are no tears,
In dreams sometimes cherished
In front of Onegin was gathered
In front of the faded houses
in front of the mirrors
in his paper hat, has more than once
In his soul not despise men;
In Moldavia, in the wilderness of the steppes,
In short, Russian moping
In spring on the grass of the meadows,
in the Academic Dictionary.
in the chronological dust
in the chronological dust of the earth's history;
In the days of mirth and desire
In the golden nights of Italy
In their captivating footsteps
In the last taste of toilette
In the midst of daily pleasures?
In the midst of glorious triumphs,
In the wilderness, the lyrical voice is more resounding,
In this case is not right at all.
invented for amusement,
In winter on the cast iron of the fireplace,
I offer you my services;
I often hear the question:
I once walked there too:
I read little, sleep long,
I remember another time!
I remember them all, and in my dreams
I remember the sea before the storm:

is more lovely to me.
It attracts by its conventional beauty
It doesn't need gold
It is familiar to me, it is dear to me.
It is holy to the grandsons of Apollo;
It's dark: he sits down in his sledge.
It's not hard for us to shine.
It's not hard to keep up.
It's not the same with us now:
It's possible to be a man of sense
It's time, it's time! - I call out to her;
It's time to leave the dull shore
It would be brave, indeed,
I've dreamed, and my soul
I've dreamt of lovely objects
I've reviewed the whole thing rigorously:
I've wasted many a life!
I wander over a deserted lake,
I wander over the sea, waiting for the weather,
I was angry, he was sullen;
I was born to a life of peace,
I was crazy about balls:
I write, and my heart does not yearn,
(Judges, resolute and strict)
Keep your lorgnette straight!
Latin is out of fashion now:
Let me introduce you:
Let me say, by the way, that all poets.
Like a breezy Venus,
Like a shadow or a faithful wife.
Like Byron, the proud poet,
Like Child-Harold, sullen and languid.
Like him, retired from the world,
Like the English splendor,
Like women, he left the books,
Like your light footprints in the meadows.
Lovely, sweet friends!
Love passed, the Muse appeared,
Love's dreamy friend.
Love's maddening anxiety
madman, will you forget them?
may talk of Seay and Bentham,
Monsieur l'Abbé, a poor Frenchman,
Monsieur was banished from the court.
More glasses, thirsty begging
My goddesses! What are you? Where are you?
My happiest days?
		My uncle was an honest man,
My youthful days were spent there.
Near the unfinished verses,
Newborn creation,
no cards, no balls, no poems.
No gossip of light, no boston,
No: his senses were soon cold in him;
No matter how hard we tried, he could not tell the difference.
No, never did a passion of passion
No, never in the fervent days
nor a sweet look, nor an immodest sigh,
nor the songs they inspire:
Nothing came out of his pen,
Nothing touched him,
Now from you, my friends,
No woman's feet, no woman's head;
O Brenta! No, I'll see you,
Of blind Fortune and men
Of charming actresses,
of his old uncle's death.
Of innocent years of prejudice
of intricate calumny,
Of ladies and fashionable geezers.
of magic sounds, feelings and thoughts;
Of men I don't judge,
Of my boiling youth
of people's tears and applause
“of the stormy waves
of the unpleasant elements,
Onegin flew to the theater,
Onegin goes to the boulevard
Onegin locked himself up at home,
Onegin, my good friend,
Onegin was, in the opinion of many.
Onegin was ready with me
Only a boat, waving its oars,
On St. Petersburg's sidewalk,
On the boxes of the ladies he doesn't know;
On the free crossroads of the sea
On the mirrored parquet of the hall,
On the snow of the north
On the stage, they gallop and clamor;
On the very morning of our days.
Or any publisher
Or else. or else, God forbid!
Or foreseeing from afar
Or shall my gloomy eye find no familiar faces
Or shone, my reader;
or the peaches full of languor;
or the roses of flaming palms,
Or to give a letter.
Outside and inside
O ye honorable spouses!
Perfume in cut crystal;
Plants, waters, forests, lands
Porcelain and bronze on the table,
Pour out a cheerful light
Preparing himself for the sake of money,
Prince Vyazemsky.
Pursue love, and then suddenly
Ready to clap the entrechat,
Remembering old loves,
Remembering the romances of former years,
rings his dinner bell.
Rises in a column of blue smoke,
Rousseau (in passing)
Sailing in a mysterious gondola;
Satire's bold lord,
Sensitive, carefree again,
Shadows walk through the solid windows,
Shall I depict in a faithful picture
She flies like fluff from the lips of Aeolus;
She, prophesying to my eye
Sighing and thinking to yourself:
Sleep on their coats at the door;
Sleeps peacefully in the shade of the blissful.
So discreet, so precise,
So full of piety,
So stately, so clever,
So that the child should not be tormented,
So, to tell you the truth,
So unapproachable to men.
So unapproachable to men,
So we were carried away by a dream
Spent my happiest days in idleness, in the shadows.
Standing there is Istomina,
Straight scissors, crooked scissors,
Suddenly he received a report
surrounded by a crowd of nymphs,
That a mocking reader
That a new ballet has begun.
That he was clever and very sweet.
that his uncle was dead in his bed
That I have painted my portrait,
That is, he could judge how a state
that London trades in the lavish trade.
That my poor syllable, as it is.
That remorse gnaws at him.
that should have been found long ago,
That's what the young hustler thought,
That's why I'm writing this,
That the same boredom was in the village,
The Adriatic waves,
The ashes that are burnt out will not flare up,
The beauties were not long
The cabman goes to the stock exchange,
The cavalier's spurs are clattering;
The child was sharp but sweet.
The conditions of light, and the burden of light,
The coolness of the dusky oak-tree,
The crowd is busy with the mazurka;
The dead man's friends and foes
The dead man was buried.
The defender of liberty and right
The desires of the willful swarm.
The double lanterns of the carriage
The eloquent madman.
The feet of the ladies are flying;
The fiery gazes of the ladies are flying,
The frosty dust is silvery
The ghost of days gone by
The goddess goes to the masquerade.
The grove, the hill, and the field did not occupy him;
The happiness of my youth is gone.
The hearts of the ladies of record!
The heat of the heart was gone in both of us;
The highest tone is rather dull;
The horn and the song
The horses are still chillin' and beating,
The hotness of rhyme: he hath doubled the sacred delirium
The hunters of the funeral.
The jealous whispers of fashionable wives.
The language of Petrarch and love.
The lanterns are shining everywhere;
The life of both of us was a torment;
The lonely fields,
The luxurious touch of the soft carpets.
The maiden of the mountains, my ideal,
The merchant rises, the peddler comes,
The more lively the creative dreams.
The morning snow is crunching beneath her.
The music was tired;
Then he saw clearly
The night sky above the Neva,
Then I'll begin to write
Then Monsieur took her place.
The noise of the morning is pleasant.
The parterre and the seats are all abuzz;
The pen, forgetting itself, does not draw,
The philosopher's office at eighteen.
The priests and guests ate and drank,
The profiles of heads glimmering
There are many contradictions,
“There are still cupids, devils, snakes.
There Diderot was crowned with glory,
There'll be a ball, there'll be a children's party.
There our Katenin resurrected
There Ozerov's tribute was unwillingly paid
There's a different kind of burden on everyone;
There's boredom, there's deceit, there's nonsense;
There's conscience, there's no sense;
There's no better place for confessions
There's noise and crowding all around;
There's no more charms for him.
There the prickly Shakhovskoy brought out
There, there, under the shadow of the backstage
The roast-beef was bloody before him,
The sacred delirium of poetry,
The second Chadaev, my Eugene,
The sentries of the night;
The serpent of remembrance,
The shutters are open; the trumpet smoke
The sound of a quiet brook;
The spectator of mirth is indifferent,
The splendid house gleams;
The subject of his habitual thoughts;
the sword and the sword and the lead.
The theater is full; the boxes are shining;
The theater's evil legislator,
The third day the grove, the hill, and the field
The tune of Torquat's octaves!
The well-dweller is carried from his sleep,
The winds of the ship's breeze.
The words and eyes of these enchantresses
They are not worthy of passion,
They're still stomping
They scold their masters and beat their hands:
They stir my heart.
though I had looked in the old days
Though it may be that some lady
Though there be no streets, no palaces,
Three houses are calling for a party:
Three pairs of slender women's legs.
Till a watchful burgher

To amuse a half-dead man,
To amuse with pleasant flattery,
To appropriate to himself the mind of others;
To be heard.
To be proud and obedient,
To bring him his medicine sadly,
To catch a moment's delight,
To conceal hope, to be jealous,
To conquer with wit and passion,
To describe my own business:
“To disbelieve, to make you believe,
To douse the hot fat of the cutlets,
To expect involuntary caresses,
To frighten with despair,
To get a secret rendezvous.

To hear the first sound of the heart,

To keep silence in an important dispute.

To lie lovingly at her feet!

To plead and demand confession,
To pour champagne on a bottle

To sigh for gloomy Russia,

Was it not so in my former years

We all learned a little
Wearing a broad bolivar,
We both knew the game of passion:
We'd better hurry to the ball,
We silently reveled in it!
We've all learned a little something and a little something,
We were divorced for a long time.

What? Invitations? Indeed,
What low treachery
What more do you want? The world has decided
What nets he prepared for them!
What occupied all the day long
What of my Onegin? Half asleep
What was for him of all his days
When, and where, in what desert,
When he got sick in a funny way,
When he had a headache
When he read the sad message,
When he wanted to destroy
When he wanted to destroy his rivals,

When it has a simple product.

Where I buried my heart.

To give her lessons in silence!
I'm always glad to notice the difference
No matter how hard we tried, he could not tell the difference.

The goddess goes to the masquerade.
that London trades in the lavish trade.
And then she'll take her stance, and then she'll take her stride, and then she'll take her stride,
Outside and inside
He bowed to the men on every side
For the quiet of the countryside:
The coolness of the dusky oak-tree,
Fate kept Eugene safe:
I've wasted many a life!
To the beginning of a young life.
But he had grown cold to life.
and the Muse brought them to life:
Alas, I've wasted a lot of my life
Like a shadow or a faithful wife.
with his dinner and his wife.
Why argue fruitlessly with the age?
The double lanterns of the carriage
That the same boredom was in the village,
But when I flew to my uncle's village,
I have kept their secret image;
When he read the sad message,
For which he ended his brilliant and rebellious age
His brilliant and rebellious age
He bowed, and then to the stage.
An honorable citizen of the backstage,
There, there, under the shadow of the backstage
familiar faces on the dull stage,
It's dark: he sits down in his sledge.
Of men I don't judge,
And said: “It's time for a change;
The cabman goes to the stock exchange,
When he had a headache
And Strasbourg's imperishable pie
Beef-steaks and Strasburger pie.
I wander over a deserted lake,
Rises in a column of blue smoke,
The shutters are open; the trumpet smoke
A reward inestimable,
Porcelain and bronze on the table,
I found it on the table,
and his jesting with bile and bile,
He entered. The hall is full of people;
And a golden pineapple.
We all learned a little
To pour champagne on a bottle
Eugene's time came,
And my imagination is again aflame,
Onegin was ready with me
We were divorced for a long time.
Because I have not sinned for a long time.
He caught fame in the meantime;
I remember another time!
How often in the summertime
I befriended him at that time.
Will the hour of my freedom come?
Onegin locked himself up at home,
It is familiar to me, it is dear to me.
is more lovely to me.
But the north is bad for me.
The second Chadaev, my Eugene,
It's not hard for us to shine.
The happiness of my youth is gone.
There's a different kind of burden on everyone;
Who are carried away by the carriages of good fortune
Who will he start with? I don't care:
For the sounds of life he could not spare,
He was sure that Kaverin was waiting for him there.
My youthful days were spent there.
The lanterns are shining everywhere;
nor the songs they inspire:
In the days of mirth and desire
And the ladies' thoughtful attire;
He saw everything: faces, attire
Here to describe his attire;
When, wearing a man's attire,
But, my God, what a bore
Will I see the Russian Terpsichore
It's time to leave the dull shore
And yet they are so pure,
I devote myself to innocent leisure,
He rushes to Talon: he's sure,
Shall I depict in a faithful picture
with their talkative lyre;
He danced the mazurka with ease
And bowed with ease;
And longed for glory and praise,
So discreet, so precise,
And the curtain rises, and makes a noise.
It's possible to be a man of sense
There's boredom, there's deceit, there's nonsense;
But their talk is unbearable, though it be innocent nonsense;
There's conscience, there's no sense;
He sits down with the laudable purpose
of people's tears and applause
He was caressed by his wicked spouse,
And the old is out of date,
That is, he could judge how a state
And afterward, in private
And leaning on the granite,
He could speak and write;
Then I'll begin to write
In the last taste of toilette
And the disappointed lorgnette,
To keep silence in an important dispute.
At first Onegin's tongue
“To disbelieve, to make you believe,
Eugene stood pensive,
The language of Petrarch and love.
But at last he fell out of love
But I was foolish and foolish in love.
How quick and tender was his eye,
She, prophesying to my eye
To occupy your curious gaze,
and her touch makes my faded heart blaze,
The winds of the ship's breeze.
How early he was able to hypocritize,
He scolded him a little for mischief
And with a troop of books he filled his shelf,
as the Piet described himself.
Always satisfied with himself,
How he could forget himself!
Sighing and thinking to yourself:
between Onegin and myself,
In the wilderness, the lyrical voice is more resounding,
More glasses, thirsty begging
To whom did thy thoughtful singing?
We've all learned a little something and a little something,
Breathing one thing, loving one thing,
He noticed nothing.
But he could not bear it; nothing
He went in, and the cork hit the ceiling,
The theater is full; the boxes are shining;
His life is ready for the morning,
I am awakened every morning
They're still stomping
In short, Russian moping
Blowing their noses, coughing, coughing, shushing, clapping;
and the crooked talk, the clamor, and the swearing!
The profiles of heads glimmering
The cavalier's spurs are clattering;
Where are the flowers of spring?
Rousseau (in passing)
The horses are still chillin' and beating,
The fiery gazes of the ladies are flying,
The feet of the ladies are flying;
A woman with a jug of water is hurrying along,
I read little, sleep long,
The beauties were not long
What occupied all the day long
The horn and the song
which Nazon had sung,
And so I, careless, have sung.
Between the cheese of Limburg
Where my Onegin has gone in a coach.
I ask you to notice my speech:
An affliction, the cause of which
How the state grows rich,
Chandra was waiting for him on his watch,
nor a sweet look, nor an immodest sigh,
He knew Latin enough,
have I ever wished with such anguish
of his old uncle's death.
For nails and teeth.
But read Adam Smith,
Beneath the long tablecloth,
On the snow of the north
I love the frenzy of youth,
Of my boiling youth
And truffles, the luxury of his youth,
When the rebellious youth
So, to tell you the truth,
On St. Petersburg's sidewalk,
The priests and guests ate and drank,
I love their feet, but I don't think
The sound of a quiet brook;
He wanted to write, but his hard work
The maiden of the mountains, my ideal,
To talk of Juvenal,
But their conversation in general
The hunters of the funeral.

Combs, files of steel,

For now of my novel

He read, he read, he read, but to no avail:

I'd still love a ball.
But, weary with the noise of the ball,
He's on his way to bed from the ball:
We'd better hurry to the ball,
On the mirrored parquet of the hall,
Here comes our hero to the hall;
In this case is not right at all.

Nothing touched him,
First Madame followed him,
His father could not understand him
Eugene immediately went to see him.
Friends and friendship bore him,
He left you all before him;
Dared to brush his nails before him,
The roast-beef was bloody before him,

No: his senses were soon cold in him;
And notes are brought to him.
For two days it seemed new to him
And she ran after him,
There's no more charms for him.
That remorse gnaws at him.
The grove, the hill, and the field did not occupy him;
Couldn't understand how the important Grim

I remember the sea before the storm:
And soon, soon the trace of the storm
The hotness of rhyme: he hath doubled the sacred delirium

All these words are not in Russian;
I have thought of the form of the plan,
Friends of Ludmila and Ruslan!

To amuse a half-dead man,
The eloquent madman.
and the distrustful old man,
Monsieur l'Abbé, a poor Frenchman,
with a young Venetian woman,
And the bread-maker, a neat German,
		My uncle was an honest man,
Where my Onegin has already ridden.
And took him for walks in the Summer Garden.
The philosopher's office at eighteen.
His father was dead then.
I was angry, he was sullen;
Of blind Fortune and men
In his soul not despise men;
Custom is a despot among men.
So unapproachable to men.
So unapproachable to men,
“Tired footmen
Nothing came out of his pen,
and, yawning, took up his pen,
I'll be inspired again,
Dressed, undressed, and dressed again?

Sensitive, carefree again,
I long again, I love again.
Her touch again
Will I hear your choruses again?
He remembered, though not without sin,
By the proud lyre of Albion
Cut in the latest fashion;
Free, I seek again the union
To conquer with wit and passion,
We both knew the game of passion:
No, never did a passion of passion
They are not worthy of passion,

He had no higher passion
To plead and demand confession,
Newborn creation,
Eugene, hating litigation,
Whose glance, stirring inspiration,
A great charm to the conversation.
Without compulsion in conversation
For luxury, for luxury, for fashionable relaxation.
He looked at the stage in great distraction
I often hear the question:
I'll soon, I'll soon, I'll soon, I'll soon, I'll soon, I'll soon, I'll soon:
Each had his own wit and reason:
As in the green forest from prison
No gossip of light, no boston,
I write, and my heart does not yearn,
Where perhaps you were born
That a new ballet has begun.
When will I start my free run?
that should have been found long ago,
Where will my mischief-maker go?
“But I've had enough of Didlo.
It is holy to the grandsons of Apollo;
I once walked there too:
And what I'll name the hero;
What of my Onegin? Half asleep
And then they made him sleep;
The well-dweller is carried from his sleep,
I hold a happy footstep.
Whom did thy verse worship?”
And he didn't get into the cheerful workshop.
The ashes that are burnt out will not flare up,
It's not hard to keep up.
And the dark mind is clear
He gave three balls every year
Or foreseeing from afar
His beaver collar.
Wearing a broad bolivar,
That a mocking reader
Or shone, my reader;
Here's our Onegin, a villager,
Till a watchful burgher
The morning snow is crunching beneath her.
It's time, it's time! - I call out to her;
Or any publisher
I wander over the sea, waiting for the weather,
To write poems about another,
And it is true that in our summer
A fickle admirer

I have finished the first chapter;
An enemy of order and a waster,
He could do no better.
Or to give a letter.
and put a vale at the end of the letter,
So stately, so clever,
And the boat waved its oars and sailed down the slumbering river:
And though he was an ardent lover
Glittering, half-air,
And there he walks in the open air,
To frighten with despair,
Like the English splendor,
“Who does your lyre sigh for?
All that Paris tastes hungry for,
French cuisine's finest color,
On the stage, they gallop and clamor;
Sleep on their coats at the door;
With one foot touching the floor,
The theater's evil legislator,
or the peaches full of languor;
With a scholarly air of a connoisseur
Without preface, this very hour
has already opened his vasisdas.
How languidly silent he was,
The lonely fields,
But ye blessed husbands,
They scold their masters and beat their hands:
To see foreign lands;
And he pledged his lands.
Plants, waters, forests, lands
You were his friends:
Lovely, sweet friends!
Now from you, my friends,
And brushes of thirty kinds
with foreign words,
Or shall my gloomy eye find no familiar faces
Though there be no streets, no palaces,
I offer you my services;
What he knew better than all the sciences,
He was a pedant in his clothes

And suddenly she leaps, and suddenly she flies,
And you young beauties

He was shy and bold, and at other times

The dead man's friends and foes
In Moldavia, in the wilderness of the steppes,
and the captive women of the Salgir's shores.
In the midst of daily pleasures?
A renegade of stormy pleasures,
I liked his features,
When I here compare my features,
And the pampering of the senses,
Near the unfinished verses,
Whose eye, with sweet caresses.
To expect involuntary caresses,
Of charming actresses,
The words and eyes of these enchantresses
In front of the faded houses
O ye honorable spouses!
The tune of Torquat's octaves!
The Adriatic waves,
And on the Baltic waves
How I envied the waves
Beneath the tempest's veil and the waves,
How I longed with the waves

The jealous whispers of fashionable wives.

In the midst of glorious triumphs,
surrounded by a crowd of nymphs,
Diana's bosom, Flora's laniths.
That's why I'm writing this,
That my poor syllable, as it is.
Like women, he left the books,
He did not bore him with strict morals,
When he wanted to destroy his rivals,
and think of the beauty of your nails:
I was crazy about balls:
And in the midday swells,
The splendid house gleams;
The more lively the creative dreams.
His involuntary devotion to his dreams,
I remember them all, and in my dreams
with the fire of unexpected epigrams.
and the malice of his gloomy epigrams.
no cards, no balls, no poems.
or the roses of flaming palms,
He appeared in the drawing-rooms;
Are you still the same maidens? Are you not the same maidens?
“To whom, in a crowd of jealous maidens?
To whom, in the crowd of jealous maidens,
There's no better place for confessions
There are many contradictions,
who was a disciple of Phoblos,
He flew up the marble steps,
In their captivating footsteps
and Petrarch in his footsteps,
To touch her feet with my lips!
I'm still sad, but there are no tears,
How his eyes shone with obedient tears!
Remembering the romances of former years,
Was it not so in my former years
Free, in the bloom of his best years,
Only a boat, waving its oars,
A greedy regiment of moneylenders.
To appropriate to himself the mind of others;
His example is a lesson to others;
He looked over all the tiers,
Follow your daughters:
All clapping. Onegin enters,
Of ladies and fashionable geezers.
I'll give the fruits of my labors
I'll give them the fruits of my labors:
in front of the mirrors
I'll pay my debt to the censors,
Straight scissors, crooked scissors,
He found the court full of favors;
And the water's cheerful glass
And St. Petersburg is restless
A time of hope and tender sadness,
His inimitable strangeness
And again, devoted to idleness,
Flowers, love, country, idleness,
Cultivated in the eastern gentleness,
As if they were doing business.
To describe my own business:
and languishing in his soul's emptiness,
His lazy laziness and his longing laziness
And the old is delirious with newness.
For now in his morning dress,
He's going home to dress.
His father lived by debts,
I've dreamt of lovely objects
“I have long endured ballets,
To douse the hot fat of the cutlets,
Let me say, by the way, that all poets.
You loved the soft carpets
The luxurious touch of the soft carpets.
With a soul full of regrets,
And the coachmen, around the lights,
of magic sounds, feelings and thoughts;
The subject of his habitual thoughts;
of the unpleasant elements,
You left no footprints:
Was he ever so happy in the midst of feasts
“Fall down, fall down!” - he shouts;
By the will of Zeus.
The heat of the heart was gone in both of us;
Corneille's majestic genius;
But in what he was a true genius,
She flies like fluff from the lips of Aeolus;
Like a breezy Venus,
To conceal hope, to be jealous,
For lumber and lard to us,
To get a secret rendezvous.
As if it were impossible for us
He scorned Homer, Theocritus;
In spring on the grass of the meadows,
Like your light footprints in the meadows.
Spent my happiest days in idleness, in the shadows.
Shadows walk through the solid windows,
To adjust his pillows,
Along the sleepy street in rows
though I had looked in the old days
A magical land! There in the old days,
But the anecdotes of bygone days
On the very morning of our days.
What was for him of all his days
No, never in the fervent days
My happiest days?
And he's very glad that he's changed his old ways
'Cause he couldn't always
Ready to clap the entrechat,

You also, mothers, be strict
When it has a simple product.
To lie lovingly at her feet!

He walks between the chairs on his feet,
The child was sharp but sweet.
That he was clever and very sweet.
Ah! For a long time I couldn't forget
Like Byron, the proud poet,
Keep your lorgnette straight!
I could before the learned light
To catch a moment's delight,
And at last he sees the light.
With soul-filled flight?
The conditions of light, and the burden of light,
Pour out a cheerful light
And, looking at the alien light.
and the morning turns to midnight,
To sit with a sick man day and night,
With the benevolent breath of the night.
All was silent; only the watchmen of the night
The sentries of the night;
The defender of liberty and right
That's what the young hustler thought,
That I have painted my portrait,
for sighs, boredom, and deceit.
Blessed is he that hath combined with it.
We silently reveled in it!
and seeing no great loss in it.
and then ungodly repeat it,
He didn't want to try it,
A scholarly little fellow, but a pedant:
The noise of the morning is pleasant.
To seem gloomy, to seem despondent,
To be proud and obedient,
and the magic bow is obedient,
He had a happy talent
invented for amusement,
But sweeter, in the midst of the night's amusement,
Afraid of jealous judgment,
and the land of my fathers and my imprisonment?
The life of both of us was a torment;
to his sarcastic argument,
Attentive or indifferent!
The spectator of mirth is indifferent,
How fervently eloquent,
content with his lot,
He who has lived and thought cannot
who speaks and speaks and speaks not,
And with a quick foot she beats her foot.
But Terpsichore's foot
To hear the first sound of the heart,
How careless in his letters of the heart!
and soothed the anguish of his heart,
Where I buried my heart.
They stir my heart.
When, and where, in what desert,
Suddenly he received a report
Monsieur was banished from the court.
He spent three hours at least
And wasted away at last.
And reminisce of the past?
How he could amaze innocence with jest,
He taught him everything in jest,
But pantaloons, tailcoat, vest,
He was a profound economist,
He had no desire to dig through the chronological dust
in the chronological dust
And the roar of the horns is drowned out
A comet's current of wine spurted out,
Treason had tired him out;
There the prickly Shakhovskoy brought out
And Onegin went out;
have not replaced you?
Let me introduce you:
O Brenta! No, I'll see you,
“When will the devil take you?”
My goddesses! What are you? Where are you?
And I see I blame myself before you,
I can't tell you;
I have a word of warning for you.
How long have I forgotten for you
And my Eugene has left you.
And far niente is my law.
The pen, forgetting itself, does not draw,
He's glad he's changed to something new.
All that Eugene yet knew,
How he knew how to seem new,
On the boxes of the ladies he doesn't know;
A complete master, but until now
Latin is out of fashion now:
And rainbows on the snow:
It's not the same with us now:
Ah, feet, feet! Where are you now?
He passed the doorman with an arrow
who, in the late hours of the day.
And tomorrow is the same as yesterday.
From Romulus to the present day

And afterward they went away,
When he got sick in a funny way,
The ghost of days gone by

And what we called a dandy.

It attracts by its conventional beauty
The parterre and the seats are all abuzz;

When he got sick in a funny way,
He made himself respected
He could do no better.
His example is a lesson to others;
But, my God, what a bore
To sit with a sick man day and night,
without taking a step away!
What low treachery

To adjust his pillows,

Friends of Ludmila and Ruslan!
To the hero of my novel
Without preface, this very hour
Let me introduce you:
Onegin, my good friend,
Was born on the banks of the Neva,
Where perhaps you were born
Or shone, my reader;
I once walked there too:
But the north is bad for me.
And he hurries to live and feels in a hurry.
Prince Vyazemsky.
Having served honorably and nobly,
His father lived by debts,
He gave three balls every year
And wasted away at last.
Fate kept Eugene safe:
First Madame followed him,
Then Monsieur took her place.
The child was sharp but sweet.
Monsieur l'Abbé, a poor Frenchman,
So that the child should not be tormented,
He taught him everything in jest,
He did not bore him with strict morals,
He scolded him a little for mischief
And took him for walks in the Summer Garden.
When the rebellious youth
Eugene's time came,
A time of hope and tender sadness,
Monsieur was banished from the court.
Here's my Onegin at liberty;
Cut in the latest fashion;
Dressed like a London dandy.
And at last he sees the light.
He could speak French perfectly
He could speak and write;
He danced the mazurka with ease
And bowed with ease;
What more do you want? The world has decided
That he was clever and very sweet.
We all learned a little
We've all learned a little something and a little something,
And so, thank God,
It's not hard for us to shine.
Onegin was, in the opinion of many.
(Judges, resolute and strict)
A scholarly little fellow, but a pedant:
He had a happy talent
Without compulsion in conversation
To touch everything lightly,
With a scholarly air of a connoisseur
To keep silence in an important dispute.
And excite the smiles of the ladies

Latin is out of fashion now:
So, to tell you the truth,
He knew Latin enough,
to parse the epigraphs,
To talk of Juvenal,
and put a vale at the end of the letter,
He remembered, though not without sin,
two verses from the Aeneid.
He had no desire to dig through the chronological dust
in the chronological dust
in the chronological dust of the earth's history;
But the anecdotes of bygone days
From Romulus to the present day
He kept them in his memory.
He had no higher passion
For the sounds of life he could not spare,
He could not distinguish iambic from choric,
No matter how hard we tried, he could not tell the difference.
He scorned Homer, Theocritus;
But read Adam Smith,
He was a profound economist,
That is, he could judge how a state
How the state grows rich,
And what it lives on, and why
It doesn't need gold
When it has a simple product.
His father could not understand him
And he pledged his lands.
All that Eugene yet knew,
I can't tell you;
But in what he was a true genius,
What he knew better than all the sciences,
What was for him of all his days
and labor and agony and joy,
What occupied all the day long
His lazy laziness and his longing laziness
was the science of tender passion,
which Nazon had sung,
For which he ended his brilliant and rebellious age
His brilliant and rebellious age
In Moldavia, in the wilderness of the steppes,
Far from his Italy.
How early he was able to hypocritize,
To conceal hope, to be jealous,
“To disbelieve, to make you believe,
To seem gloomy, to seem despondent,
To be proud and obedient,
Attentive or indifferent!
How languidly silent he was,
How fervently eloquent,
How careless in his letters of the heart!
Breathing one thing, loving one thing,
How he could forget himself!
How quick and tender was his eye,
He was shy and bold, and at other times
How his eyes shone with obedient tears!
How he knew how to seem new,
How he could amaze innocence with jest,
To frighten with despair,

Of innocent years of prejudice
To conquer with wit and passion,
To expect involuntary caresses,
To plead and demand confession,
To hear the first sound of the heart,
Pursue love, and then suddenly
To get a secret rendezvous.
And afterward, in private
To give her lessons in silence!
How early could he disturb
The hearts of the ladies of record!
When he wanted to destroy
When he wanted to destroy his rivals,
How he sarcastically maligned them!
What nets he prepared for them!
But ye blessed husbands,
You were his friends:
He was caressed by his wicked spouse,
who was a disciple of Phoblos,
and the distrustful old man,
And the cuckold's majestic cuckold,
Always satisfied with himself,
with his dinner and his wife.
He'd be still in bed:
And notes are brought to him.
What? Invitations? Indeed,
Three houses are calling for a party:
There'll be a ball, there'll be a children's party.
Where will my mischief-maker go?
Who will he start with? I don't care:
It's not hard to keep up.
For now in his morning dress,
Wearing a broad bolivar,
Onegin goes to the boulevard
And there he walks in the open air,
Till a watchful burgher
rings his dinner bell.
It's dark: he sits down in his sledge.
“Fall down, fall down!” - he shouts;
The frosty dust is silvery
His beaver collar.
He rushes to Talon: he's sure,
He was sure that Kaverin was waiting for him there.
He went in, and the cork hit the ceiling,
A comet's current of wine spurted out,
The roast-beef was bloody before him,
And truffles, the luxury of his youth,
French cuisine's finest color,
And Strasbourg's imperishable pie
Between the cheese of Limburg
And a golden pineapple.
More glasses, thirsty begging
To douse the hot fat of the cutlets,
But the clang of the breguet tells them
That a new ballet has begun.
The theater's evil legislator,
A fickle admirer
Of charming actresses,
An honorable citizen of the backstage,
Onegin flew to the theater,
Where everyone, breathing freely,
Ready to clap the entrechat,
To smear Phaedra, Cleopatra,
To summon Moina,
To be heard.
A magical land! There in the old days,
Satire's bold lord,
Fonvizin, the friend of liberty,
And Knyazhnin, the friend of liberty;
There Ozerov's tribute was unwillingly paid
of people's tears and applause
He shared with the young Semyonova;
There our Katenin resurrected
Corneille's majestic genius;
There the prickly Shakhovskoy brought out
his comedies a noisy swarm,
There Diderot was crowned with glory,
There, there, under the shadow of the backstage
My youthful days were spent there.
My goddesses! What are you? Where are you?
Hear my sorrowful voice:
Are you still the same maidens? Are you not the same maidens?
have not replaced you?
Will I hear your choruses again?
Will I see the Russian Terpsichore
With soul-filled flight?
Or shall my gloomy eye find no familiar faces
familiar faces on the dull stage,
And, looking at the alien light.
And the disappointed lorgnette,
The spectator of mirth is indifferent,
I'll yawn silently
And reminisce of the past?
The theater is full; the boxes are shining;
The parterre and the seats are all abuzz;
And the rak'ryck is splashing impatiently,
And the curtain rises, and makes a noise.
Glittering, half-air,
and the magic bow is obedient,
surrounded by a crowd of nymphs,
Standing there is Istomina,
With one foot touching the floor,
With the other she slowly circles,
And suddenly she leaps, and suddenly she flies,
She flies like fluff from the lips of Aeolus;
And then she'll take her stance, and then she'll take her stride, and then she'll take her stride,
And with a quick foot she beats her foot.
All clapping. Onegin enters,
He walks between the chairs on his feet,
He points his double lorgnette obliquely.
On the boxes of the ladies he doesn't know;
He looked over all the tiers,
He saw everything: faces, attire
He's terribly displeased;
He bowed to the men on every side
He bowed, and then to the stage.
He looked at the stage in great distraction
He turned away and yawned,
And said: “It's time for a change;
“I have long endured ballets,
“But I've had enough of Didlo.
“There are still cupids, devils, snakes.
On the stage, they gallop and clamor;
“Tired footmen
Sleep on their coats at the door;
They're still stomping
Blowing their noses, coughing, coughing, shushing, clapping;
Outside and inside
The lanterns are shining everywhere;
The horses are still chillin' and beating,
and their harnesses bore them,
And the coachmen, around the lights,
They scold their masters and beat their hands:
And Onegin went out;
He's going home to dress.
Shall I depict in a faithful picture
A secluded study,
where the fashionable pupil
Dressed, undressed, and dressed again?
All the things that for whimsy's abundance
that London trades in the lavish trade.
And on the Baltic waves
For lumber and lard to us,
All that Paris tastes hungry for,
A useful trade in the world,
invented for amusement,
For luxury, for luxury, for fashionable relaxation.
All adorned the office
The philosopher's office at eighteen.
Amber on the pipes of Tzaregrad,
Porcelain and bronze on the table,
And the pampering of the senses,
Perfume in cut crystal;
Combs, files of steel,
Straight scissors, crooked scissors,
And brushes of thirty kinds
For nails and teeth.
Rousseau (in passing)
Couldn't understand how the important Grim
Dared to brush his nails before him,
The eloquent madman.
The defender of liberty and right
In this case is not right at all.
It's possible to be a man of sense
and think of the beauty of your nails:
Why argue fruitlessly with the age?
Custom is a despot among men.
The second Chadaev, my Eugene,
Afraid of jealous judgment,
He was a pedant in his clothes
And what we called a dandy.
He spent three hours at least
in front of the mirrors
And came out of the restroom
Like a breezy Venus,
When, wearing a man's attire,
The goddess goes to the masquerade.
In the last taste of toilette
To occupy your curious gaze,
I could before the learned light
Here to describe his attire;
It would be brave, indeed,
To describe my own business:
But pantaloons, tailcoat, vest,
All these words are not in Russian;
And I see I blame myself before you,
That my poor syllable, as it is.
could be much less crowded
with foreign words,
though I had looked in the old days
in the Academic Dictionary.
It's not the same with us now:
We'd better hurry to the ball,
Where my Onegin has gone in a coach.
Where my Onegin has already ridden.
In front of the faded houses
Along the sleepy street in rows
The double lanterns of the carriage
Pour out a cheerful light
And rainbows on the snow:
Dotted with carrots all round,
The splendid house gleams;
Shadows walk through the solid windows,
The profiles of heads glimmering
Of ladies and fashionable geezers.
Here comes our hero to the hall;
He passed the doorman with an arrow
He flew up the marble steps,
And spread his hair with his hand,
He entered. The hall is full of people;
The music was tired;
The crowd is busy with the mazurka;
There's noise and crowding all around;
The cavalier's spurs are clattering;
The feet of the ladies are flying;
In their captivating footsteps
The fiery gazes of the ladies are flying,
And the roar of the horns is drowned out
The jealous whispers of fashionable wives.
In the days of mirth and desire
I was crazy about balls:
There's no better place for confessions
Or to give a letter.
O ye honorable spouses!
I offer you my services;
I ask you to notice my speech:
I have a word of warning for you.
You also, mothers, be strict
Follow your daughters:
Keep your lorgnette straight!
Or else. or else, God forbid!
That's why I'm writing this,
Because I have not sinned for a long time.
Alas, I've wasted a lot of my life
I've wasted many a life!
But if my morals had not suffered,
I'd still love a ball.
I love the frenzy of youth,
I love the crowdedness, the splendor, and the joy,
And the ladies' thoughtful attire;
I love their feet, but I don't think
You'll not find in Russia
Three pairs of slender women's legs.
Ah! For a long time I couldn't forget
Two legs... Sad, chilled,
I remember them all, and in my dreams
They stir my heart.
When, and where, in what desert,
madman, will you forget them?
Ah, feet, feet! Where are you now?
Where are the flowers of spring?
Cultivated in the eastern gentleness,
On the snow of the north
You left no footprints:
You loved the soft carpets
The luxurious touch of the soft carpets.
How long have I forgotten for you
And longed for glory and praise,
and the land of my fathers and my imprisonment?
The happiness of my youth is gone.
Like your light footprints in the meadows.
Diana's bosom, Flora's laniths.
Lovely, sweet friends!
But Terpsichore's foot
is more lovely to me.
She, prophesying to my eye
A reward inestimable,
It attracts by its conventional beauty
The desires of the willful swarm.
I love her, my friend Elvina,
Beneath the long tablecloth,
In spring on the grass of the meadows,
In winter on the cast iron of the fireplace,
On the mirrored parquet of the hall,
By the sea on the granite of the cliffs.
I remember the sea before the storm:
How I envied the waves
“of the stormy waves
To lie lovingly at her feet!
How I longed with the waves
To touch her feet with my lips!
No, never in the fervent days
Of my boiling youth
have I ever wished with such anguish
to lick the lips of young Armida,
or the roses of flaming palms,
or the peaches full of languor;
No, never did a passion of passion
has ever so tormented my soul!
I remember another time!
In dreams sometimes cherished
I hold a happy footstep.
And feel the foot in my hand;
And my imagination is again aflame,
Her touch again
and her touch makes my faded heart blaze,
I long again, I love again.
But let us glorify the haughty
with their talkative lyre;
They are not worthy of passion,
nor the songs they inspire:
The words and eyes of these enchantresses
are as deceitful as their feet.
What of my Onegin? Half asleep
He's on his way to bed from the ball:
And St. Petersburg is restless
is awakened by the drum.
The merchant rises, the peddler comes,
The cabman goes to the stock exchange,
A woman with a jug of water is hurrying along,
The morning snow is crunching beneath her.
The noise of the morning is pleasant.
The shutters are open; the trumpet smoke
Rises in a column of blue smoke,
And the bread-maker, a neat German,
in his paper hat, has more than once
has already opened his vasisdas.
But, weary with the noise of the ball,
and the morning turns to midnight,
Sleeps peacefully in the shade of the blissful.
A child of amusement and luxury.
Wakes at noon, and again.
His life is ready for the morning,
and his life is monotonous and variegated.
And tomorrow is the same as yesterday.
But was my Eugene happy,
Free, in the bloom of his best years,
In the midst of glorious triumphs,
In the midst of daily pleasures?
Was he ever so happy in the midst of feasts
Careless and healthy?
No: his senses were soon cold in him;
He was bored with the noise of the world;
The beauties were not long
The subject of his habitual thoughts;
Treason had tired him out;
Friends and friendship bore him,
'Cause he couldn't always
Beef-steaks and Strasburger pie.
To pour champagne on a bottle
And sprinkle a sharp word
When he had a headache
And though he was an ardent lover
But at last he fell out of love
the sword and the sword and the lead.
An affliction, the cause of which
that should have been found long ago,
Like the English splendor,
In short, Russian moping
has taken possession of him;
He shot himself, thank God,
He didn't want to try it,
But he had grown cold to life.
Like Child-Harold, sullen and languid.
He appeared in the drawing-rooms;
No gossip of light, no boston,
nor a sweet look, nor an immodest sigh,
Nothing touched him,
He noticed nothing.
Fanciers of the great world!
He left you all before him;
And it is true that in our summer
The highest tone is rather dull;
Though it may be that some lady
may talk of Seay and Bentham,
But their conversation in general
But their talk is unbearable, though it be innocent nonsense;
And yet they are so pure,
So stately, so clever,
So full of piety,
So discreet, so precise,
So unapproachable to men,
So unapproachable to men.
And you young beauties
who, in the late hours of the day.
Who are carried away by the carriages of good fortune
On St. Petersburg's sidewalk,
And my Eugene has left you.
A renegade of stormy pleasures,
Onegin locked himself up at home,
and, yawning, took up his pen,
He wanted to write, but his hard work
But he could not bear it; nothing
Nothing came out of his pen,
And he didn't get into the cheerful workshop.
Of men I don't judge,
because I belong to them.
And again, devoted to idleness,
and languishing in his soul's emptiness,
He sits down with the laudable purpose
To appropriate to himself the mind of others;
And with a troop of books he filled his shelf,
He read, he read, he read, but to no avail:
There's boredom, there's deceit, there's nonsense;
There's conscience, there's no sense;
There's a different kind of burden on everyone;
And the old is out of date,
And the old is delirious with newness.
Like women, he left the books,
And the shelf with their dusty family,
and the shelf with their dusty family.
The conditions of light, and the burden of light,
Like him, retired from the world,
I befriended him at that time.
I liked his features,
His involuntary devotion to his dreams,
His inimitable strangeness
And a sharp, chilled mind.
I was angry, he was sullen;
We both knew the game of passion:
The life of both of us was a torment;
The heat of the heart was gone in both of us;
Both of us awaited the malice
Of blind Fortune and men
On the very morning of our days.
He who has lived and thought cannot
In his soul not despise men;
He who has felt is troubled
The ghost of days gone by
There's no more charms for him.
The serpent of remembrance,
That remorse gnaws at him.
All this often gives
A great charm to the conversation.
At first Onegin's tongue
confounded me; but I was accustomed
to his sarcastic argument,
and his jesting with bile and bile,
and the malice of his gloomy epigrams.
How often in the summertime
When the night sky above Nevoya
The night sky above the Neva,
And the water's cheerful glass
does not reflect the face of Diana,
Remembering the romances of former years,
Remembering old loves,
Sensitive, carefree again,
With the benevolent breath of the night.
We silently reveled in it!
As in the green forest from prison
The well-dweller is carried from his sleep,
So we were carried away by a dream
To the beginning of a young life.
With a soul full of regrets,
And leaning on the granite,
Eugene stood pensive,
as the Piet described himself.
All was silent; only the watchmen of the night
The sentries of the night;
and the distant clatter of the droves
From Millionnya suddenly sounded;
Only a boat, waving its oars,
And the boat waved its oars and sailed down the slumbering river:
And we were captivated in the distance
The horn and the song
But sweeter, in the midst of the night's amusement,
The tune of Torquat's octaves!
The Adriatic waves,
O Brenta! No, I'll see you,
I'll be inspired again,
I'll hear your magic voice!
It is holy to the grandsons of Apollo;
By the proud lyre of Albion
It is familiar to me, it is dear to me.
In the golden nights of Italy
I'll enjoy it in the wild,
with a young Venetian woman,
who speaks and speaks and speaks not,
Sailing in a mysterious gondola;
With her my lips shall find
The language of Petrarch and love.
Will the hour of my freedom come?
It's time, it's time! - I call out to her;
I wander over the sea, waiting for the weather,
The winds of the ship's breeze.
Beneath the tempest's veil and the waves,
On the free crossroads of the sea
When will I start my free run?
It's time to leave the dull shore
of the unpleasant elements,
And in the midday swells,
under the sky of Africa,
To sigh for gloomy Russia,
Where I have suffered, where I have loved,
Where I buried my heart.
Onegin was ready with me
To see foreign lands;
But we were soon divorced
We were divorced for a long time.
His father was dead then.
In front of Onegin was gathered
A greedy regiment of moneylenders.
Each had his own wit and reason:
Eugene, hating litigation,
content with his lot,
He gave them his inheritance,
and seeing no great loss in it.
Or foreseeing from afar
of his old uncle's death.
Suddenly he received a report
A report from the steward
that his uncle was dead in his bed
and would be glad to bid him farewell.
When he read the sad message,
Eugene immediately went to see him.
He rushed at once to the post-office.
And was yawning beforehand,
Preparing himself for the sake of money,
for sighs, boredom, and deceit.
(And thus began my romance);
But when I flew to my uncle's village,
I found it on the table,
As a tribute to the land.
He found the court full of favors;
The dead man's friends and foes
and foes and friends came to see the dead man,
The hunters of the funeral.
The dead man was buried.
The priests and guests ate and drank,
And afterward they went away,
As if they were doing business.
Here's our Onegin, a villager,
Plants, waters, forests, lands
A complete master, but until now
An enemy of order and a waster,
And he's very glad that he's changed his old ways
He's glad he's changed to something new.
For two days it seemed new to him
The lonely fields,
The coolness of the dusky oak-tree,
The sound of a quiet brook;
The third day the grove, the hill, and the field
The grove, the hill, and the field did not occupy him;
And then they made him sleep;
Then he saw clearly
That the same boredom was in the village,
Though there be no streets, no palaces,
no cards, no balls, no poems.
Chandra was waiting for him on his watch,
And she ran after him,
Like a shadow or a faithful wife.
I was born to a life of peace,
For the quiet of the countryside:
In the wilderness, the lyrical voice is more resounding,
The more lively the creative dreams.
I devote myself to innocent leisure,
I wander over a deserted lake,
And far niente is my law.
I am awakened every morning
To sweet comfort and freedom:
I read little, sleep long,
I don't catch any flying glory.
Was it not so in my former years
Spent my happiest days in idleness, in the shadows.
My happiest days?
Flowers, love, country, idleness,
Fields! I am devoted to you with my soul.
I'm always glad to notice the difference
between Onegin and myself,
That a mocking reader
Or any publisher
of intricate calumny,
When I here compare my features,
and then ungodly repeat it,
That I have painted my portrait,
Like Byron, the proud poet,
As if it were impossible for us
To write poems about another,
but of ourselves.
Let me say, by the way, that all poets.
Love's dreamy friend.
I've dreamt of lovely objects
I've dreamed, and my soul
I have kept their secret image;
and the Muse brought them to life:
And so I, careless, have sung.
The maiden of the mountains, my ideal,
and the captive women of the Salgir's shores.
Now from you, my friends,
I often hear the question:
“Who does your lyre sigh for?
To whom, in the crowd of jealous maidens,
“To whom, in a crowd of jealous maidens?
Whose glance, stirring inspiration,
Whose eye, with sweet caresses.
To whom did thy thoughtful singing?
Whom did thy verse worship?”
And, my friends, no one, by God!
Love's maddening anxiety
I have been sadly troubled.
Blessed is he that hath combined with it.
The hotness of rhyme: he hath doubled the sacred delirium
The sacred delirium of poetry,
and Petrarch in his footsteps,
and soothed the anguish of his heart,
He caught fame in the meantime;
But I was foolish and foolish in love.
Love passed, the Muse appeared,
And the dark mind is clear
Free, I seek again the union
of magic sounds, feelings and thoughts;
I write, and my heart does not yearn,
The pen, forgetting itself, does not draw,
Near the unfinished verses,
No woman's feet, no woman's head;
The ashes that are burnt out will not flare up,
I'm still sad, but there are no tears,
And soon, soon the trace of the storm
I'll soon, I'll soon, I'll soon, I'll soon, I'll soon, I'll soon, I'll soon:
Then I'll begin to write
A poem of twenty-five songs.
I have thought of the form of the plan,
And what I'll name the hero;
For now of my novel
I have finished the first chapter;
I've reviewed the whole thing rigorously:
There are many contradictions,
But I don't want to correct them.
I'll pay my debt to the censors,
I'll give the fruits of my labors
I'll give them the fruits of my labors:
Come to the shores of the Neva,
Newborn creation,
And earn my glory:
and the crooked talk, the clamor, and the swearing!
